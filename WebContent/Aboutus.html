						<p>Ironheart stores the first 6 and last 4 digits of your card
							number in a secure and encrypted manner. The first 6 digits (also
							known as the Bank Identification Number) are used to identify the
							bank name and country where your card was issued. The first 6 and
							last 4 digits are together used for fraud detection and
							prevention purposes.</p>
						<p>
							<strong>What are the delivery charges?</strong>
						</p>
						<p>Delivery charge varies with each Seller.</p>
						<p>Sellers incur relatively higher shipping costs on low value
							items. In such cases, charging a nominal delivery charge helps
							them offset logistics costs. Please check your order summary to
							understand the delivery charges for individual products.</p>
						<p>For Products listed as F-Assured a Rs 40 charge for
							delivery per item is applied if the order value is less than Rs
							500. While, orders of Rs 500 or above are delivered free.</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Why does the delivery date not correspond to the
								delivery timeline of X-Y business days?</strong>
						</p>
						<p>It is possible that the Seller or our courier partners have
							a holiday between the day your placed your order and the date of
							delivery, which is based on the timelines shown on the product
							page. In this case, we add a day to the estimated date. Some
							courier partners and Sellers do not work on Sundays and this is
							factored in to the delivery dates.</p>
						<p>
							<strong>What is the estimated delivery time?</strong>
						</p>
						<p>Sellers generally procure and ship the items within the
							time specified on the product page. Business days exclude public
							holidays and Sundays.</p>
						<p>Estimated delivery time depends on the following factors:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The Seller offering the product</li>
							<li>Product's availability with the Seller</li>
							<li>The destination to which you want the order shipped to
								and location of the Seller.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							<strong>Are there any hidden costs (sales tax, octroi
								etc) on items sold by Sellers on Ironheart?</strong>
						</p>
						<p>There are NO hidden charges when you make a purchase on
							Ironheart. List prices are final and all-inclusive. The price you
							see on the product page is exactly what you would pay.</p>
						<p>Delivery charges are not hidden charges and are charged (if
							at all) extra depending on the Seller's shipping policy.</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Why does the estimated delivery time vary for
								each seller?</strong>
						</p>
						<p>You have probably noticed varying estimated delivery times
							for sellers of the product you are interested in. Delivery times
							are influenced by product availability, geographic location of
							the Seller, your shipping destination and the courier partner's
							time-to-deliver in your location.</p>
						<p>Please enter your default pin code on the product page (you
							don't have to enter it every single time) to know more accurate
							delivery times on the product page itself.</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Seller does not/cannot ship to my area. Why?</strong>
						</p>
						<p>Please enter your pincode on the product page (you don't
							have to enter it every single time) to know whether the product
							can be delivered to your location.</p>
						<p>If you haven't provided your pincode until the checkout
							stage, the pincode in your shipping address will be used to check
							for serviceability.</p>
						<p>Whether your location can be serviced or not depends on</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Whether the Seller ships to your location</li>
							<li>Legal restrictions, if any, in shipping particular
								products to your location</li>
							<li>The availability of reliable courier partners in your
								location</li>
						</ul>
						<p>At times Sellers prefer not to ship to certain locations.
							This is entirely at their discretion.</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Why is the CoD option not offered in my
								location?</strong>
						</p>
						<p>Availability of CoD depends on the ability of our courier
							partner servicing your location to accept cash as payment at the
							time of delivery.</p>
						<p>Our courier partners have limits on the cash amount payable
							on delivery depending on the destination and your order value
							might have exceeded this limit. Please enter your pin code on the
							product page to check if CoD is available in your location.</p>
						<p>
							<strong>I need to return an item, how do I arrange for a
								pick-up?</strong>
						</p>
						<p>Returns are easy. Contact Us to initiate a return. You will
							receive a call explaining the process, once you have initiated a
							return.</p>
						<p>Wherever possible Ekart Logistics will facilitate the
							pick-up of the item. In case, the pick-up cannot be arranged
							through Ekart, you can return the item through a third-party
							courier service. Return fees are borne by the Seller.</p>
						<p>
							<strong>What do the different tags like "In Stock",
								"Available" mean?</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>'In Stock'</strong>
						</p>
						<p>FFor items listed as "In Stock", Sellers will mention the
							delivery time based on your location pincode (usually 2-3
							business days, 4-5 business days or 4-6 business days in areas
							where standard courier service is available). For other areas,
							orders will be sent by Registered Post through the Indian Postal
							Service which may take 1-2 weeks depending on the location.</p>
						<p>
							<strong>'Available'</strong>
						</p>
						<p>The Seller might not have the item in stock but can procure
							it when an order is placed for the item. The delivery time will
							depend on the estimated procurement time and the estimated
							shipping time to your location.</p>
						<p>
							<strong>'Preorder' or 'Forthcoming'</strong>
						</p>
						<p>Such items are expected to be released soon and can be
							pre-booked for you. The item will be shipped to you on the day of
							it's official release launch and will reach you in 2 to 6
							business days. The Preorder duration varies from item to item.
							Once known, release time and date is mentioned. (Eg. 5th May,
							August 3rd week)</p>
						<p>
							<strong>'Out of Stock'</strong>
						</p>
						<p>Currently, the item is not available for sale. Use the
							'Notify Me' feature to know once it is available for purchase.</p>
						<p>
							<strong>'Imported'</strong>
						</p>
						<p>Sometimes, items have to be sourced by Sellers from outside
							India. These items are mentioned as 'Imported' on the product
							page and can take at least 10 days or more to be delivered to
							you.</p>
						<p>
							<strong>'Back In Stock Soon'</strong>
						</p>
						<p>The item is popular and is sold out. You can however 'book'
							an order for the product and it will be shipped according to the
							timelines mentioned by the Seller.</p>
						<p>
							<strong>'Temporarily Unavailable'</strong>
						</p>
						<p>The product is currently out of stock and is not available
							for purchase. The product could to be in stock soon. Use the
							'Notify Me' feature to know when it is available for purchase.</p>
						<p>
							<strong>'Permanently Discontinued'</strong>
						</p>
						<p>This product is no longer available because it is obsolete
							and/or its production has been discontinued.</p>
						<p>
							<strong>'Out of Print'</strong>
						</p>
						<p>This product is not available because it is no longer being
							published and has been permanently discontinued.</p>
