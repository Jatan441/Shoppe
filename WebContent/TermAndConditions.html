					<p>Disputes (Resolutions) Policy</p>
					<p>Overview</p>
					<p>Generally, transactions are conducted smoothly on Ironheart.
						However there may be some cases where both the Buyers and Sellers
						may face issues. At Ironheart, we have a Dispute Resolution
						process in order to resolve disputes between Buyers and Sellers.</p>
					<p>What is a 'dispute'?</p>
					<p>A 'Dispute' can be defined as a disagreement between a Buyer
						and a Seller in connection with a transaction on the Platform.</p>
					<p>How does a 'dispute' occur in the Marketplace?</p>
					<p>Disputes are filed as a result of a disagreement between the
						Buyer and the Seller. Disputes arise out of an issue that is
						raised by either party not being completely satisfied with the
						resolution of their complaint/issue.</p>
					<p>It is important that before a Buyer/Seller raises a dispute,
						they should attempt to solve the issue. Please note that whenever
						a Buyer raises a dispute, the Seller's payment for that order is
						put on hold immediately until the issue is resolved.</p>
					<p>How is a 'dispute' created?</p>
					<p>Whenever there is a disagreement, the Buyer can write to
						dispute@Ironheart.com, while the Seller can write to
						ss@Ironheart.com, in order to raise a dispute. Disputes can be
						raised at a particular transaction level.</p>
					<p>What are the various types of 'disputes'?</p>
					<p>Following are the indicative examples of potential disputes:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Wrong item received</li>
						<li>Item Not as described</li>
						<li>Damaged or Seal broken on Product</li>
						<li>Part/Accessory missing</li>
						<li>Item not Compatible</li>
						<li>Seller Description/Specification Wrong</li>
						<li>Defective (Functional issues)</li>
						<li>Product not working and Manufacturer claims invalid
							Invoice</li>
					</ol>
					<p>In case the Seller rejects the return request of the Buyer,
						and Buyer raises a dispute, then Ironheart will try to mediate and
						resolve the dispute between both the parties. If the dispute is
						resolved in favour of the Buyer, a refund is provided once the
						product is returned to the Seller. If the dispute is settled in
						favour of the Seller, Buyer is entitled to any refund.</p>
					<p>Buyer Protection Program</p>
					<p>In case of a dispute where the Seller is unable to provide a
						refund or a replacement, Ironheart will actively work towards
						reaching a resolution.</p>
					<p>The Buyer Protection Program covers Buyers who are unable to
						successfully resolve their dispute with the Seller or are not
						satisfied the resolution provided by the Seller.</p>
					<p>The Buyer can write to resolution@Ironheart.com if the issue
						with the Seller is not resolved. Ironheart's Customer Support team
						will look into the case to check for possible fraud and if the
						Buyer has been blacklisted/blocked from making purchases on the
						Platform. Only after verifying these facts, a dispute can be
						registered.</p>
					<p>In due course of resolution, Ironheart's Customer Support
						Team will facilitate a conference call including the Seller and
						the Buyer.</p>
					<p>When a dispute has been raised, Ironheart may provide both
						the parties access to each others Display Names, contact details
						including email addresses and other details pertaining to the
						dispute. Buyers and Sellers are subject to final consent from
						Ironheart for settling the dispute.</p>

						are eligible for the Buyer Protection Program.</p>

						covered under this program and will completely be the Buyer's
						responsibility. Buyers should refuse to accept delivery if the
						item is damaged.</p>
					<p>To be able to take advantage of the Buyer Protection
						Program, Buyers should first contact the Seller and attempt to
						resolve the issue. If the Buyer doesn't hear from the Seller or is
						unable to resolve the issue with the Seller even after contact, a
						dispute can be raised with Ironheart by writing an email to
						resolution@Ironheart.com</p>
					<p>Fraudulent charges and claims are not covered under Buyer
						Protection Program</p>

						process only such claims that are valid and genuine.</p>

					<p>Disputes (Resolutions) Policy</p>
					<p>Overview</p>
					<p>Generally, transactions are conducted smoothly on Ironheart.
						However there may be some cases where both the Buyers and Sellers
						may face issues. At Ironheart, we have a Dispute Resolution
						process in order to resolve disputes between Buyers and Sellers.</p>
					<p>What is a 'dispute'?</p>
					<p>A 'Dispute' can be defined as a disagreement between a Buyer
						and a Seller in connection with a transaction on the Platform.</p>
					<p>How does a 'dispute' occur in the Marketplace?</p>
					<p>Disputes are filed as a result of a disagreement between the
						Buyer and the Seller. Disputes arise out of an issue that is
						raised by either party not being completely satisfied with the
						resolution of their complaint/issue.</p>
					<p>It is important that before a Buyer/Seller raises a dispute,
						they should attempt to solve the issue. Please note that whenever
						a Buyer raises a dispute, the Seller's payment for that order is
						put on hold immediately until the issue is resolved.</p>
					<p>How is a 'dispute' created?</p>
					<p>Whenever there is a disagreement, the Buyer can write to
						dispute@Ironheart.com, while the Seller can write to
						ss@Ironheart.com, in order to raise a dispute. Disputes can be
						raised at a particular transaction level.</p>
					<p>What are the various types of 'disputes'?</p>
					<p>Following are the indicative examples of potential disputes:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Wrong item received</li>
						<li>Item Not as described</li>
						<li>Damaged or Seal broken on Product</li>
						<li>Part/Accessory missing</li>
						<li>Item not Compatible</li>
						<li>Seller Description/Specification Wrong</li>
						<li>Defective (Functional issues)</li>
						<li>Product not working and Manufacturer claims invalid
							Invoice</li>
					</ol>
					<p>In case the Seller rejects the return request of the Buyer,
						and Buyer raises a dispute, then Ironheart will try to mediate and
						resolve the dispute between both the parties. If the dispute is
						resolved in favour of the Buyer, a refund is provided once the
						product is returned to the Seller. If the dispute is settled in
						favour of the Seller, Buyer is entitled to any refund.</p>
					<p>Buyer Protection Program</p>
					<p>In case of a dispute where the Seller is unable to provide a
						refund or a replacement, Ironheart will actively work towards
						reaching a resolution.</p>
					<p>The Buyer Protection Program covers Buyers who are unable to
						successfully resolve their dispute with the Seller or are not
						satisfied the resolution provided by the Seller.</p>
					<p>The Buyer can write to resolution@Ironheart.com if the issue
						with the Seller is not resolved. Ironheart's Customer Support team
						will look into the case to check for possible fraud and if the
						Buyer has been blacklisted/blocked from making purchases on the
						Platform. Only after verifying these facts, a dispute can be
						registered.</p>
					<p>In due course of resolution, Ironheart's Customer Support
						Team will facilitate a conference call including the Seller and
						the Buyer.</p>
					<p>When a dispute has been raised, Ironheart may provide both
						the parties access to each others Display Names, contact details
						including email addresses and other details pertaining to the
						dispute. Buyers and Sellers are subject to final consent from
						Ironheart for settling the dispute.</p>
					<p>Buyer Eligibility and Restrictions</p>
					<p>Only the Buyers who have purchased the product on Ironheart
						are eligible for the Buyer Protection Program.</p>
					<p>Buyers can file a dispute within 45 days from the date of
						delivery of the product</p>
					<p>Any damage or loss to the product after delivery will not be
						covered under this program and will completely be the Buyer's
						responsibility. Buyers should refuse to accept delivery if the
						item is damaged.</p>
					<p>To be able to take advantage of the Buyer Protection
						Program, Buyers should first contact the Seller and attempt to
						resolve the issue. If the Buyer doesn't hear from the Seller or is
						unable to resolve the issue with the Seller even after contact, a
						dispute can be raised with Ironheart by writing an email to
						resolution@Ironheart.com</p>
					<p>Fraudulent charges and claims are not covered under Buyer
						Protection Program</p>
					<p>If the Buyer has already initiated chargeback through the
						credit card issuing bank, it will not be covered under Buyer
						Protection Program, though in such cases a Seller can file a claim
						through the Seller Protection Program.</p>
					<p>Blacklisted and Blocked Buyers are not covered by the Buyer
						Protection Program.</p>
					<p>Buyers who have reached their maximum lifetime limit for
						claims are also not eligible. Buyers can make a maximum of 5
						claims per year on Ironheart. If the claim was withdrawn, it is
						not counted. The coverage amount will be limited to â‚¹50,000</p>
					<p>Through the Buyer Protection program, Ironheart does not
						provide any guarantee/warranty to Buyers for products sold on
						Ironheart against technical/manufacturing defects.</p>

						entitle the Buyer to a refund or replacement for the product
						purchased. Ironheart shall verify the disputes so raised and may
						process only such claims that are valid and genuine.</p>
					<p>Ironheart shall at no point be responsible for any direct or
						indirect losses, expenses, costs of any nature whatsoever that may

					<p>Ironheart Customer Support Team may seek additional
						information / clarification from Buyer to facilitate resolution of
						the dispute. In the event Buyer does not respond with information
						/ clarification sought within 10 days of such request, the dispute
						shall be auto-closed in favour of the Seller.</p>
					<p>Disputes via Chargeback</p>

						<li>Unauthorized CB - Buyer hasn't made this particular
							transaction. Refund will be created in accordance with the
							dispute policies.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Seller expressly agrees that issuing the correct and
						complete invoice is the sole and primary responsibility of the
						Seller. Furthermore, Seller shall ensure that invoices state
						"Powered by Ironheart" and failing to do so Seller will be liable
						for chargebacks (as applicable).</p>
					<ol>

							expected. Dispute will be decided in accordance with the dispute
							policies.</li>
